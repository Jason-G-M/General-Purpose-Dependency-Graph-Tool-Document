# 1. Introduction

General-purpose Dependency Graph Tool (GP-DGT) is designed to analyze and display the relationships of references among assemblies and types.

# 2. Install & Run

Run `start.ps1` or `docker-compose up` at the root path.

# 3 Assembly package demo

## Demo files

The assembly package demo consists of two folders, either folder corresponds to version 1.0.0.0 and 1.0.0.1 respectively, they are prepared for DGT to scan, analyze and generate the graph. The structures of the files in both folders are shown below.

![Folder 1.0.0.0](image/Folder1.0.0.0.png "Folder 1.0.0.0")

**Folder 1.0.0.0**

Folder 1.0.0.0 consists of **Root.dll**, **Son.dll**, **Daughter.dll**, **Grandson.dll**, **Nuget.Common.dll** and **SimpleInjector.dll**. Root.dll file is the start assembly file.
## Start with a script

![Folder 1.0.0.1](image/Folder1.0.0.1.png "Folder 1.0.0.1")

**Folder 1.0.0.1**

Folder 1.0.0.1 consists of **Root.dll**, **Son.dll**, **Daughter.dll**, **Grandson.dll**, **Granddaughter.dll**, **Nuget.Common.dll** and **SimpleInjector.dll**. Root.dll file is the start assembly file.

### Note 

- 1.0.0.0 and 1.0.0.1 are [assembly file versions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/assembly/versioning), which means in Folder 1.0.0.0, all the assembly file versions of the repo are 1.0.0.0. The rule also adapts to Folder 1.0.0.1.
- In the figures of the files structures, system assemblies have been hidden.
- The dependency relation between every two nodes is similar to that of the ethical relation. For example, Root.dll node depends on Son.dll and Daughter.dll nodes. Son.dll node depends on Grandson.dll and Nuget.Common.dll nodes.
- In most cases, all the assembly file versions of a repo are the same, which can help to differentiate whether the current repo is NuGet or not.
- Generally, the assembly file version is the same as the [build version](https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/build). Get [more information](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/assembly/set-attributes) here if user demands to change the assembly file version.

**The assembly file version is the same as the build version (product version).**

# 4. Operation Manual

## 4.1 Initialization

Data of analysis is required for using this tool. Users are supposed to config and scan to generate the data at the very beginning of using this tool.

### 4.1.1 Process config

#### Usage

Config the name of processes and starting assemblies before scanning.

#### Instruction

- Go to SYSTEM -> PROCESS CONFIG.

- Click ADD NEW to add a new config.

![process config](image/System/ProcessConfig.png "process config")

- Input process name and starting assemblies in the dialogue, click OK to submit.

![dialogue](image/System/ProcessConfigPopUp.png "dialogue")

- Click EDIT or DELETE to update or remove an existing config.

![process config edit](image/System/ProcessConfigEdit.png "process config edit")

### 4.1.2 Scan Status

#### Usage

- Scan the targets to get data of analysis.

#### Instruction

- Go to SYSTEM -> SCAN STATUS.
- Place the file to be scanned into the workspace folder.

![scan status](image/System/Scan.png "Scan status")

![customize folder](image/System/folder.JPG "Folder")

**Users may customise the workspace folder by changing the value of "workspace" at docker-compose.yml**

- Select the target folder and click SCAN to start the scanning. FORCE SCAN is a back up option for the case of scanning failure.

![scan Select](image/System/ScanSelect.png "Scan Select")

- Once the scanning is accomplished, results are displayed in the table. Results with status SUCCESS will provide data of analysis to the tools.

![scan result](image/System/ScanResult.png "Scan result")

## 4.2 Dashboard

This page is designed to display overall information of compatible and incompatible APIs of different processes in different builds. The data of this page is from analyzing the demo we have prepared.

### Charts

The dashboard contains four charts.
- [Pie charts of version's status](#Pie-charts-of-version's-status), showing the number of compatible and incompatible APIs.
- [Trend over builds](#Trend-over-builds), showing the version status change over time.
- [Overlaps per build](#Overlaps-per-build), showing the impact on other processes.
- [All processes per build](#All-processes-per-build), showing the overall situation for all onboard processes.

![dashboard overview](image/DashboardOverview.png "Dashboard overview")

**Dashboard overview**

#### Pie charts of version's status

![Proportion](image/Proportion.png "Proportion of compatibles and incompatibles")

**Proportion of compatibles and incompatibles**

- Total: Sum of the compatible and incompatible APIs from DefaultRepo and Nuget. For example, in the figure above, the number of compatible APIs in Total, 14, comes from 4 compatible APIs in DefaultRepo and 10 Compatible APIs from Nuget; and the number of Incompatible APIs in Total, 0, comes from 0 Incompatible APIs in - DefaultRepo and 0 Incompatible APIs from Nuget.
DefaultRepo: The content of the DefaultRepo pie chart comes from your repo (or your project). For example, in Demo 1.0.0.0 shown below, Root.dll, Son.dll, Daughter.dll, and GrandSon.dll are created by yourself (you define them) in your repo (or project), so the DefaultRepo pie chart is made up by these four files (nodes). Since APIs of them are all compatible, the pie chart shows that Compatible is 4 and Incompatible is 0.

![Demo 1.0.0.0](image/Demo1.0.0.0.png "Demo 1.0.0.0")

**Demo 1.0.0.0**

- Nuget: NuGet is the package manager for .NET. The pie chart shows the number of compatible and incompatible APIs coming from NuGet.  For the demo case, Demo 1.0.0.0 uses 10 APIs from NuGet, so in the pie chart, the compatible is 10 and the incompatible is 0.
- Package: It shows the number of compatible and incompatible assemblies in all NuGet packages. The information in this chart is set manually. The default info shows that all the APIs are incompatible, while users can mark any NuGet assemblies compatible. The total number of APIs in the Package pie chart is the same as those in the NuGet pie chart. Visit [Assembly Detail](#5.2.5-Assembly-Details) for more information. 

#### Trend over builds

![TrendOverBuilds](image/TrendOverBuilds.png "Trend over builds")

**Number of compatibles and incompatibles of each build**

#### Overlaps per build

![Overlaps Per Build](image/OverlapsPerBuild.png "Overlaps per build")

** Overlaps and differences between current build and others**

#### All processes per build

![All processes](image/AllProcessesPerBuild.png "All processes")

**Number of compatibles and incompatibles of each process in the current build.**

#### Note

- The results shown on this page are from Demo 1.0.0.0.
- Make sure you match the version and process name. The version is the file version of your repo, and the process name can be found in the Process Config page.

#### Machenism

This is a brief introduction of how the target assembly is splitted. Assuming we are going to split the assembly X, which is referenced by Y and Z.

![Machenism1](image/AssemblySplitter/SplitRule1.png "Before splitting")

**Y and Z are assemblies depending our target assembly X, a,b,c,d and e are types of X**

On splitting, types of the target assembly directly depended by parent assemblies are "colored" respectively (a and b), then the coloring spreads through the reference of each colored type. Types with multiple up-level types in different colors will be given a new color (d is given a new color).
When the coloring is done, types are separated into groups according to their colors (a and b are seprated into different assemblies, d and e in same assembly). Types that had never been colored are separated into "Untouchable part" group (c in Untouchable part).

![Machenism2](image/AssemblySplitter/SplitRule2.png "On splitting")

**The splitting machenism**

In condition of "Equal inward assemblies" is applied, types called by bundled incoming references will be colored same (if Y and Z are "Equal", a and b will be colored same).
In condition of "Type Closures" is applied, bundled types will be colored same in any condition (if a and b are bundled, they always have the same color).
